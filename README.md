# Getting Started with React App

Bookify is a simple web app that helps people buy and sell books online. When you visit the site, you can create an account or log in. Once logged in, you can add books you want to sell by filling out a form. On the home page, you’ll see a list of all books available, and you can click on any book to view its details and buy it. After you place an order, you’ll get a message confirming your purchase. You can also check your orders to see what you’ve bought. The navigation bar at the top makes it easy to move between pages like Home, Add Listing, Orders, Register, and Login. Bookify uses Firebase to manage user accounts and store information about books and orders, making everything work smoothly behind the scenes.
